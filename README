New features:
 - Open Quora in a new tab by clicking the logo
 - Top 3 notifications are shown in the popup
 
Current problems:
 - Regex for finding notifications looks for an <a> timestamp, 
   while some notifications (comments) use <span> instead

Todo:
 - Display more than just 3 notifications on the homepage.
   Apparently viewing the mobile notifications page won't mark
   everything as read (and probably loads faster!)
